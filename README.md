### Project Overview
---
This project aims to analyze the Sleep Health and Lifestyle dataset to identify patterns and trends related to stress levels, sleep quality, physical activity, BMI, and heart rate. The objective is to extract meaningful insights that can help improve overall well-being.

### Data Source
This dataset was gotten from kaggle

### Tool
- Power BI - Data Cleaning and Creating Report

### Data Cleaning
To ensure data consistency and clarity, Power BI was used to modify values in the BMI Category column, renaming "Normal" to "Normal Weight." This change enhances interpretability while maintaining data accuracy.

### Questions
1. How does stress level impact the quality of sleep?
2. What is the distribution of stress levels among different occupations?
3. What is the total physical activity level for individuals with different sleep disorders?
4. How do sleep duration and sleep quality vary across different BMI categories?
5. What is the average heart rate across different BMI categories?

### Data Analysis and Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. Analysis of the data indicates a negative correlation between stress levels and sleep quality. Higher stress levels are associated with lower sleep quality, suggesting that managing stress effectively may contribute to better sleep.
2. Distribution of Stress Levels Among Different Occupations shows that nurses and doctors report the highest stress levels, followed by engineers, lawyers, and teachers. Professions with lower stress levels include sales representatives and managers, possibly due to differences in job responsibilities and work-life balance.
3. Individuals without sleep disorders report the highest physical activity levels (12.7K total), whereas those with sleep apnea and insomnia engage in significantly lower levels of physical activity (5.8K and 3.6K, respectively). This suggests a potential link between physical activity and sleep health.
4. Normal-weight individuals exhibit the highest sleep duration and quality (1.7K and 1.6K total, respectively). Overweight individuals have moderate values (1.0K), whereas obese individuals report the lowest sleep duration and quality (0.1K). This highlights the impact of BMI on sleep patterns.
5. The analysis shows that normal-weight individuals have the lowest average heart rate (68.98 bpm), followed by overweight individuals (70.95 bpm), while obese individuals have the highest (84.30 bpm). This reinforces the known relationship between BMI and cardiovascular health.

### Recommendations

- Stress Management: High-stress occupations such as nursing and medical professions may benefit from workplace wellness programs and mindfulness training.
- Physical Activity Promotion: Encouraging regular physical activity can help individuals with sleep disorders improve their sleep quality.
- Healthy BMI Maintenance: A balanced diet and exercise regimen can contribute to healthier sleep patterns and better heart rate regulation.
- Tailored Sleep Interventions: Personalized sleep interventions based on BMI and occupation can enhance overall well-being.

### Conclusion

The findings indicate that stress management, maintaining a healthy BMI, and engaging in regular physical activity can positively impact sleep quality and overall health. Occupation-related stress may require targeted interventions to improve sleep and well-being in high-stress professions.
